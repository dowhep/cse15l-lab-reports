# Lab Report 2 - 1/12/2022
This is the lab that created my first personal website git repo!

## Adding links
Lastly, we need to create a link from the main page to the screenshot page we have just created (this page!)

uh turns out this is actually the second lab report...

Also the reason there were two links initially is that I was testing out both the absolute link path and the relative link path.  

## Recursion
Finally, as an optional task, we need to tranform this page into an actual lab report
